## Introduction
A supermarket is self-service shop offering a wide variety of item like sporting, clothing, books, furniture, groceries and fashion. It is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket.

Here I have used different techniques to viaualize the data set of supermarket.
