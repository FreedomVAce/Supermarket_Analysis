## Introduction
A supermarket is a self-service shop offering a wide variety of items like sporting, clothing, books, furniture, groceries, and fashion. It is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket.

Here I have used different techniques to visualize the data set of the supermarket. <br>
What will you discover from this analysis?

- Average monthly Consumption
- Average Monthly Consumption Amount
- Customer unit price
- Consumer Trends

Weekly sales conclusion: Overall, the peak sales on Monday, and Friday match people's weekly work cycle, and the lowest sales on Sunday, probably because the customer wants to rest at home and prepare to work on Monday.

Daily sales conclusion: There will be obvious peaks and troughs, on the whole, typical peaks are periodic within a certain error range, and the peak points can be extracted separately, query the date of the day, marketing plans, holidays, and other factors to analyze and explore sales.

Do high-selling products have higher sales? It can be seen that it is not necessarily that some categories have weak sales but higher sales volume. Categories with high sales volume but low profits can be used as drainage products to increase customer unit prices.
